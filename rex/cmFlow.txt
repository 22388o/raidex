Flow of REX

1. Maker opens a raiden channel with commitment service
    The amount of the channel is the total amount the maker can use to make commitment deposits
    Third party can verify the total possible spending amount
2. CS receives message with offer O from maker. Offer should include address of raiden channel too
    With address of payment channel, we can verify that channel has been created and a deposit exists
3. CS listens for commitments received and keeps a total balance of commitments received
    If no commitment is received corresponding to an offer within a timeout period, the offer is invalid
    This way we always know if current commitment deposits match the standing orders
4. If the commitment is received in time, CS signs the offer and sends it back to the maker
5. Receive a taker commit message stating what offer, channel address and commitment amount
6. Listen for commit to happen like in 3
7. Check if offer has already been taken or timedout, if so, refund the commitment
8. Receive message from one of the participants that the transfer went through.
    If this does not happen within timeout for trade, the funds will be burned
9. CS sends back commitment to maker and taker, minus a small fee that CS keeps
10. Notify broadcaster than order is no longer available
