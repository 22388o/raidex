> **INFO:** The current raidEX version is a work in progress proof-of-concept to show how a DEX could be built on top of Raiden. 

## Fixing the custodian issue

While there are already decentralized exchanges, they are built on the blockchain and inherit the performance restrictions of global consensus systems, i.e. especially latency and limited transaction throughput, which result in low liquidity for these exchanges. These prevent them from being anywhere near practical for real world usage.


## High throughput & low latency

The mentioned performance restrictions are overcome by off-chain state technology, i.e. the Raiden Network for Ethereum. As raidEX is based on the Ethereum platform and the Raiden Network, it is fully interoperable and leverages synergies with tokens and apps in the Ethereum ecosystem.

## About The Project

// TODO - Adapt

The [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/) is an off-chain scaling solution, enabling near-instant, low-fee and scalable payments. It’s complementary to the Ethereum blockchain and works with any ERC20 compatible token.

The Raiden client code is available [here](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden) and has been [released for mainnet](https://medium.com/raiden-network/red-eyes-mainnet-release-announcement-d48235bbef3c) with a limited alpha release of the Raiden Network in December 2018.

The goal of the Raiden Light Client SDK is to provide an easy-to-use framework, which can be integrated by any JavaScript developer. The SDK will simplify the process of embedding and using the Raiden Network for token transfers in decentralized applications

With the SDK we want to make your life as a dApp dev easier:

* You should be able to interact with the Raiden Network easily with your dApp.
* We want to help you to enable your users to make token transfers using their consumer wallets like imToken or Metamask.
* It should be possible to send tokens using low end devices, which would not be capable of running a full Raiden node.

## Architecture

// TODO: Adapt

### [Raiden Light Client SDK](./raiden/README.md)

This is a standalone Typescript library which contains all the low level machinery to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the Raiden Network.

Its target audience is blockchain and dApp developers looking into interacting with and performing payments through the Raiden Network from their apps. Targeting browsers and Node.js as initial platforms allows it to reach the majority of current and in-development dApps, as well as to work as a common language reference implementation for ports and re-implementations in other future languages and environments.

Look at the [Raiden Light Client SDK folder of this repository](./raiden/README.md) for more information.

### Raiden dApp

The Raiden dApp is the demo and first dApp user of the SDK. It's a single page application (SPA) built on top of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) and [vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) as UI framework which uses Material Design as the design guideline.

## Getting Started

### Learn about Raiden

If you didn't use Raiden before, you can

* Checkout the [developer portal](http://developer.raiden.network)
* Look at the [documentation](https://raiden-network.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
* Learn more by watching explanatory [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoUP_hnjUddEvbxmtNCcApg)
* Read the blog posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@raiden_network)

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you must
* [Install Raiden](https://raiden-network.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview_and_guide.html)
* [Create an account, get some testnet ETH and tokens](https://github.com/raiden-network/workshop/)

## Installation

1) `git clone https://github.com/brainbot-com/raidex.git`
2) `cd raidex`
3) Install with `python setup.py develop`.

### Run

The easiest way to test the functionality of raidex is achieved with a special command that mocks all 
the networking activity as well as the commitment-service in one process.
Additionally, different types of bots can be started, to introduce some trading activity.

```
raidex --mock-networking --api --bots liquidity random manipulator
```

After installing all dependecies (see `./webui/README.md`), the WebUI can than be started
with:
 
```
cd webui
ng serve
```
